# chart
- need the total number of the bars printed on the end of the bar
- need a interactive legend added for the users, and on hover of a users should hightlight all the user segments
- a bug i noticed with the current chart if there is only data for one bar the svg height isnt large enough with xaxis ticks and cuts my bar in half

i know i suck at d3 ha first time using it so any refactor for mistakes i may have made would be nice
